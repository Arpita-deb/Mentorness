Have you ever wondered how analysts sift through vast databases to find just the right information?

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
In this video, we’ll explore the powerful logical operators in SQL or Structured Query Language.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Logical Operators are a part of a family of operators in SQL.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Today we'll learn about 3 most commonly used operators.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Let's start with AND.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
When we use AND, all conditions must be true for a row to be included in the result set.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Imagine you need to find customers who are both Sales Rep and from the city of London—AND does the trick!

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It retrieves only those customers who are both Sales Rep and from London.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Now, meet OR—it's the "either-or" operator.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
If any condition is true, it gets a ticket to the result set.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Whether you're looking for customers from Seattle or those who are Owners, OR lets you do it in a single query!

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Finally there's NOT. If a condition is false, NOT makes it true.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Want to find customers who aren't Sales Rep or Sales Managers? NOT is your go-to operator!

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You can combine these operators to create powerful, complex queries.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Let’s recap -

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Logical operators allow us to filter data based on specific conditions.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
The AND operator retrieves data only if all the conditions are TRUE.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
With the OR operator, we can retrieve data if any of the conditions are TRUE.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
When we use NOT, we get data that is not TRUE according to a specific condition.

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:44,000
In conclusion, logical operators—AND, OR, NOT—give us precise control over the database queries, making SQL a versatile tool for data management and analysis.
